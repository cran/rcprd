Description: Simplify the process of extracting and processing Clinical Practice
  Research Datalink (CPRD) data in order to build datasets ready for statistical
  analysis. This process is difficult in 'R', as the raw data is very large and 
  cannot be read into the R workspace. 'rcprd' utilises 'RSQLite' to create 
  'SQLite' databases which are stored on the hard disk. These are then  queried 
  to extract the required information for a cohort of interest, and create 
  datasets ready for statistical analysis. The  processes follow closely that 
  from the 'rEHR' package, see Springate et al., (2017)
